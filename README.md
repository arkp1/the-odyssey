## Overview

This site is built as a long vertical narrative. Each scroll section acts as a “chapter” in Odysseus’ journey, introducing gods like Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, and others, each with lore, symbols, and lesser-known facts. The focus is immersion: parallax waves, subtle animations, and an Odyssey-themed color palette (Aegean blues, bronze, parchment tones).
